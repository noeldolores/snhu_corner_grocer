# SNHU Corner Grocer
Inventory App for CS-210


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A program that analyzes text records that list items purchased. The program can take user search input to return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word, a list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased, and a histogram of all items purchased.

What did you do particularly well?
I kept the code clean and easy to follow.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could add checks for unexpected inputs. I could also create a seperate class for the menu handling.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was designing/organizing the classes. I used some of my previous projects as reference for the classes setup. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Obejct-oriented design will be transferrable to most projects going forward.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept the code base clean with simple functions, and easy to follow design.
